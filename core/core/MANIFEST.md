# Core Manifest

This manifest defines the protection level of the OFN core.

## Stability Level
- Intended to be stable over long horizons
- Backward compatibility is a priority

## Change Policy
Any modification to core files requires:
1. An approved RFC
2. A version bump
3. Clear migration notes (if applicable)

## Authority
The core represents the source of truth.
Implementations must conform to the core,
never the other way around.
