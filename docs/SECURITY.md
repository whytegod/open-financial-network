# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Issues

The Open Financial Network (OFN) takes security seriously.

If you discover a security vulnerability affecting:
- The protocol specifications
- Reference implementations
- Documentation that could lead to unsafe implementations

please report it responsibly.

## How to Report

Do NOT open a public issue for security-related reports.

Instead, contact:

**Email:** security@openfinancial.network  
*(temporary placeholder until governance assigns an official contact)*

Include:
- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
- Affected components or documents
- Potential impact assessment

## Scope

This security policy applies to:
- Protocol specifications
- Reference documentation
- Example or reference code included in this repository

It does NOT apply to:
- Third-party implementations
- External deployments
- Forked or modified versions of OFN

---

## Disclosure Process

1. Report is acknowledged
2. Issue is reviewed privately
3. Mitigation or clarification is prepared
4. Disclosure occurs responsibly if required

All protocol-level changes resulting from security findings must follow the RFC and governance process.

---

## Safe Harbor

The OFN project supports responsible security research conducted:
- In good faith
- Without exploiting users or systems
- Without public disclosure before coordination

---

## Final Note

OFN is a protocol framework.

Security is a shared responsibility between:
- Specification authors
- Implementers
- Operators

Thank you for helping keep the ecosystem safe.
