# Project Status

## Overview

The Open Financial Network (OFN) is a protocol specification project defining a neutral, open framework for interoperable financial systems.

This repository contains the authoritative documentation for OFN version 1.0, including protocol concepts, governance processes, security considerations, and implementation guidance.

OFN is currently in a **pre-implementation** phase.

---

## Current Phase

**Status:** Specification Freeze (v1.0)  
**Phase:** Research & Design Finalization

All core documents are considered stable and frozen unless modified through the formal RFC governance process.

---

## Authoritative Documents

The following documents define OFN v1.0 and are considered authoritative:

- WHITEPAPER.md — Vision, goals, and problem statement
- TECHPAPER.md — Technical architecture and protocol mechanics
- GOVERNANCE.md — Decision-making and protocol evolution framework
- SECURITY.md — Responsible disclosure and security policy
- THREAT-MODEL.md — Protocol-level threat analysis
- RFCs (RFC-0001 through RFC-0008) — Formal specifications and extensions

Any changes to these documents must follow the RFC process defined in `docs/rfc/`.

---

## In Scope

The current scope of OFN includes:

- Protocol specification and documentation
- Governance and RFC processes
- Security and threat modeling
- Reference implementation planning (non-binding)

---

## Out of Scope

The following are explicitly out of scope at this stage:

- Production deployments
- Token issuance or economic models
- Network launches
- Commercial offerings
- Timelines or roadmap commitments
- Centralized control or operational authority

---

## Implementation Status

No official implementation of the OFN protocol exists at this time.

Any future implementation efforts will be:
- Optional
- Non-authoritative
- Subject to independent review
- Aligned with the frozen specifications

Reference implementations, if introduced, will serve as educational and validation tools only.

---

## Governance and Evolution

OFN evolves exclusively through its governance and RFC process.

Unilateral changes, informal edits, or undocumented decisions are not considered valid protocol evolution.

---

## External Review

The project is open to:
- Technical review
- Security analysis
- Governance feedback

Feedback should follow responsible disclosure practices and governance guidelines.

---

## Disclaimer

OFN is a protocol specification, not a financial product, service, or institution.

Use of the specifications is voluntary and at the discretion of independent implementers.
