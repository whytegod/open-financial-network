# Open Financial Network (OFN) 

## Abstract

Open Financial Network (OFN) is an open, decentralized financial infrastructure designed to support secure value exchange, digital asset issuance, and interoperable financial services across diverse institutional and non-institutional environments.

OFN prioritizes transparency, security, and long-term scalability over short-term speculation, while remaining neutral to jurisdiction, asset type, and participant class.

## Problem Statement

Modern financial systems suffer from:
- Centralized control and opaque decision-making
- Limited access across borders
- High transaction costs
- Fragile trust models
- Regulatory incompatibility with open systems

Existing blockchain solutions often optimize for speculation rather than real financial utility.

---


## Proposed Solution

OFN proposes an open financial network that:
- Uses a modular and layered architecture
- Separates core infrastructure from applications and policy layers
- Supports peer-to-peer value transfer
- Enables participants with differing regulatory requirements to coexist through optional compliance modules
- Is built with compliance-awareness rather than compliance avoidance
---

## Core Principles

- Open participation
- Transparent governance
- Security-first design
- Neutral infrastructure
- Gradual decentralization

---

## Economic Model (High-Level)

OFN does not prioritize inflationary token mechanics or speculative economic design.

Economic activity is based on:
- Cost-based transaction fees
- Service-based compensation for infrastructure operation
- Optional asset issuance and lifecycle management
- Usage-driven service interactions

Exact economic parameters are intentionally conservative and evolve through documented governance processes.
---

## Governance

OFN governance is:
- Proposal-driven
- Documentation-first
- Transparent and auditable

No single entity controls protocol evolution.

---

## Roadmap (Conceptual)

1. Specification & documentation
2. Reference implementation
3. Test network
4. Security review
5. Gradual public adoption

---

## Conclusion

OFN aims to become a durable financial infrastructure layer rather than a speculative product.

Sustainability, trust, and openness are prioritized above speed and hype.
