# Open Financial Network – Technical Paper

## 1. Network Overview
OFN is a peer-to-peer financial network composed of validating nodes, client nodes, and gateway nodes.

## 2. Network Model
- Peer-to-peer (P2P)
- Gossip-based message propagation
- Deterministic state replication

## 3. Core Components
- Node software
- Consensus engine
- Ledger/state machine
- Networking layer
- Security layer

## 4. Consensus (Initial)
The initial version will use a simple, secure consensus model before evolving into a more advanced system.

## 5. Security Model
- Cryptographic signatures
- Immutable state history
- Node authentication
- Threat-based design

## 6. Scalability Plan
- Horizontal node scaling
- Sharding (future)
- Off-chain computation (future)
