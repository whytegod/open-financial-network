# OFN RFCs (Request for Comments)

This directory contains formal specifications that define the behavior, rules, and guarantees of the Open Financial Network (OFN).

RFCs are the authoritative source of truth for protocol behavior.

## RFC Structure

Each RFC:
- Has a unique identifier (RFC-XXXX)
- Describes a single protocol concern
- Is immutable once finalized
- May only be superseded by a new RFC

---

## RFC Lifecycle

1. Draft – initial proposal
2. Review – public discussion and feedback
3. Final – frozen and authoritative
4. Superseded – replaced by newer RFC

## Governance

RFC changes require:

No single party has unilateral control over RFC approval.
