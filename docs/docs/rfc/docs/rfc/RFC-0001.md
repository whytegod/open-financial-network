# RFC-0001: Node Identity and Roles

## Status
Draft

## Abstract

This RFC defines the identity model and basic roles of nodes participating in the Open Financial Network (OFN).

It establishes minimal assumptions required for peer interaction without enforcing centralized control.

---

## Node Identity

Each node in OFN MUST possess a unique node identifier (`node_id`).

### Requirements
- `node_id` MUST be unique within the network
- `node_id` MUST be locally generated
- `node_id` MUST NOT rely on centralized assignment

The format of `node_id` is implementation-defined but MUST be deterministic and stable across restarts.

---

## Node Lifecycle

A node exists in one of the following states:
- Inactive
- Active

A node becomes **Active** only after explicit startup by its operator.

Nodes MUST NOT assume peer trust based solely on identity.

---

## Node Roles

OFN defines the following logical roles:

### Full Node
- Validates protocol state
- Participates in consensus
- Stores full state

### Relay Node
- Propagates messages
- Does not validate full state

### Client Node
- Creates transactions
- Does not participate in consensus

A single implementation MAY support multiple roles.

---

## Peer Relationships

Nodes maintain a local list of peers.

- Peer connections are non-exclusive
- Peer connections are revocable
- No peer is trusted by default

Peers MAY exchange messages only after explicit connection.

---

## Security Considerations

- Node identity alone does not imply trust
- Sybil resistance is not enforced at the identity layer
- Higher-layer mechanisms MUST handle abuse mitigation

---

## Compatibility

This RFC is compatible with the current reference implementation (`src/node.py`).

---

## Future Work

- Identity verification schemes
- Cryptographic authentication
- Peer reputation systems
