# RFC-0001: Open Financial Network (OFN) — Purpose & Principles

- RFC ID: 0001
- Status: Draft
- Created: 2026-01

## 1. Abstract

The Open Financial Network (OFN) is an open, permissionless financial coordination protocol designed to enable transparent, interoperable, and trust-minimized financial systems.

OFN does not seek to replace existing financial institutions. Instead, it provides a neutral foundational layer upon which open financial tools, markets, and services can be built.

---

## 2. Motivation

Modern financial systems suffer from fragmentation, opacity, and centralized control.

Users, developers, and institutions lack:
- Transparent settlement logic
- Open interoperability standards
- Neutral financial infrastructure not controlled by a single entity

OFN exists to define a shared financial substrate that is:
- Open by default
- Verifiable by anyone
- Governed through explicit, documented processes

---

## 3. Core Principles

OFN is governed by the following non-negotiable principles:

1. **Openness**  
   All protocol specifications are publicly documented and accessible.

2. **Neutrality**  
   OFN does not privilege any participant, institution, or jurisdiction.

3. **Composability**  
   Financial components built on OFN must be interoperable and modular.

4. **Transparency**  
   Protocol behavior must be auditable and deterministic.

5. **Minimalism**  
   OFN defines only what is necessary at the protocol layer.

---

## 4. Non-Goals

OFN explicitly does NOT aim to:
- Act as a bank or custodian
- Issue a native currency by default
- Enforce jurisdiction-specific financial regulation
- Provide end-user financial products

These concerns are intentionally left to higher-level implementations.

---

## 5. Governance

Changes to OFN are proposed through the RFC process.

Once an RFC reaches "Accepted" status, it becomes a stable part of the protocol specification and may only be modified through a superseding RFC.

---

## 6. Status

This RFC defines the philosophical and functional foundation of the Open Financial Network.

All subsequent RFCs must remain consistent with the principles defined herein.
