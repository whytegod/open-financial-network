## Summary

This RFC defines how decisions are made and how changes are introduced to the Open Financial Network (OFN).

---

## Governance Principles

OFN governance must:
- Be transparent
- Be predictable
- Minimize centralized control
- Allow gradual decentralization

---

## Governance Participants

Participants MAY include:
- Core contributors
- Validators
- Asset issuers
- Identity providers
- Community representatives

Participation criteria is defined outside the core protocol.

---

## Decision Domains

Governance MAY apply to:
- Protocol upgrades
- Parameter adjustments
- Emergency actions
- Standards ratification

Not all protocol components are governable.

---

## Proposal Process

Changes MUST follow:
1. RFC submission
2. Public review
3. Approval mechanism
4. Scheduled execution

Emergency processes are exceptional.

---

## Voting Models

Governance MAY support:
- Token-weighted voting
- Identity-based voting
- Delegate voting
- Multi-class voting

Voting models are modular.

---

## Upgrade Mechanism

Upgrades MUST be:
- Backward-aware
- Versioned
- Auditable

Critical upgrades MAY require supermajority approval.

---

## Emergency Powers

Emergency actions MAY include:
- Temporary pauses
- Parameter freezes
- Rollbacks

Emergency authority MUST be limited and transparent.

---

## Governance Transparency

All governance actions MUST be:
- Publicly recorded
- Time-stamped
- Reversible where possible

---

## Risks & Mitigations

- Governance capture
- Voter apathy
- Upgrade fragmentation

Mitigation strategies evolve over time.

---

## Future Work

- Governance token RFC
- Validator governance RFC
- Dispute resolution RFC

---

## Conclusion

This RFC establishes a flexible governance framework that balances security, adaptability, and decentralization for OFN.
