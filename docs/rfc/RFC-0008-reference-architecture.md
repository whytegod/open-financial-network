- RFC ID: 0008
- Status: Draft
- Author: OFN Core Contributors

## 1. Overview

This RFC defines the economic model of the Open Financial Network (OFN), including fee mechanisms, service-based compensation, sustainability principles, and anti-abuse economics.

OFN economics are designed for financial infrastructure, not speculative markets.

---

## 2. Design Principles

The economic model follows these principles:

- Infrastructure-first sustainability
- Cost-based participation
- Neutrality across participants
- Abuse resistance
- Regulatory compatibility
- Governance accountability

OFN does not promise yield, profit, or passive income.

---

## 3. Economic Roles

### Network Participants
Users and institutions that submit transactions or interact with OFN services.  
Participants pay usage-based fees proportional to consumed resources.

### Validators / Operators
Entities responsible for validation and network availability.  
They are compensated for operational services, not rewarded for speculation.

### Asset Issuers
Entities that create and manage assets.  
Issuers pay lifecycle and registry fees reflecting administrative overhead.

### Governance Actors
Participants involved in protocol decision-making.  
Governance participation is responsibility-driven, not extractive.

---

## 4. Fee Model

OFN applies transparent, cost-based fees to recover operational and governance expenses.

### Transaction Fees
Assessed based on:
- Transaction size and complexity
- Execution and validation cost
- State storage impact

### Asset Issuance Fees
Apply to:
- Asset creation
- Metadata updates
- Registry maintenance
- Compliance overhead

### Governance & Administrative Fees
May apply to:
- Proposal submission
- Registry management
- Parameter adjustments

Fees are neutral and non-discriminatory.

---

## 5. Service-Based Compensation

OFN compensates participants for verifiable services such as:
- Transaction validation
- Infrastructure operation
- Compliance processing
- Governance facilitation

Compensation is:
- Cost-recovery based
- Non-guaranteed
- Independent of asset holding

---

## 6. Anti-Abuse Economics

OFN employs:
- Non-zero transaction costs
- Rate limiting
- Penalties for misuse

Economic friction exists to prevent spam and denial-of-service abuse.

---

## 7. Monetary Policy

OFN does not mandate a native inflationary asset.

If native units exist:
- Supply rules MUST be explicit
- Changes MUST go through governance
- No implicit yield is allowed

---

## 8. Sustainability & Funding

Network funding MAY support:
- Infrastructure maintenance
- Security operations
- Governance administration

No revenue guarantees are implied.

---

## 9. Governance Interaction

Economic parameters MAY be adjusted via RFC-defined governance processes in RFC-0005.

All changes must be transparent and auditable.

---

## 10. Risks & Limitations

Participation in OFN does not guarantee:
- Economic benefit
- Cost recovery
- Regulatory acceptance
- Network availability

Participants are responsible for legal and regulatory compliance.

---

## 11. Conclusion

This RFC establishes a safe, neutral, and sustainable economic foundation for OFN.
